Welcome! This document collects everything you need to set up a working development environment for Agentic Index.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS. Windows users can use WSL.
- Python 3.11+
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large assets.

## Fork & Clone
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<you>/Agentic-Index.git
   cd Agentic-Index
   ```

## Install Dependencies
Use the helper script to install all runtime and development dependencies and set up editable installs:
```bash
bash scripts/agent-setup.sh
```
This installs `pre-commit` and performs a `pip install -e .` under the hood.
CI and production run on **Python 3.11** with dependencies pinned in
`requirements.lock`. Use the same version locally to avoid surprises:
```bash
pyenv install 3.11.12  # if needed
pyenv local 3.11.12
pip install -r requirements.lock
```

For a full environment setup—including every package needed for the test
suite—source `scripts/setup-env.sh`. The script installs the contents of
`dev-requirements.lock` and ensures `pytest` can run without missing modules.

## Pre-commit Hooks
Activate hooks so formatting and lint checks run before each commit. The hooks
run **Black**, **Isort**, **Flake8**, and the unit tests:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
Run them manually on changed files with:
```bash
pre-commit run --files <path>
```

## Running Tests
Run the full test suite with:
```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" pytest -q
```
To mimic CI's network restrictions use:
```bash
CI_OFFLINE=1 pytest --disable-socket
```

### Generating Category READMEs
After running the ranking pipeline you can create one `README_<Category>.md` per
category with:
```bash
python scripts/inject_readme.py --all-categories
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Network errors when installing packages** – use the mirror described in [docs/CI_SETUP.md](CI_SETUP.md).
- **GitHub API rate limits** – export `GITHUB_TOKEN_REPO_STATS` with a personal token or lower `--min-stars` when scraping.
- **Windows path issues** – run tools inside WSL or use forward slashes.

Use the provided dev container to get a consistent development setup.

## GitHub Codespaces
1. Open the repository on GitHub and click **Code**.
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab and create a new codespace.
3. The container builds automatically and runs `scripts/setup-env.sh` on first launch.

## VS Code Remote – Containers
1. Install the *Dev Containers* extension for VS Code.
2. Clone this repository locally and open it in VS Code.
3. Press `F1` and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
4. The environment builds and forwards port 8000 for the API server.
